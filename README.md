# Non-Escalator Relationship Menu

This project uses a simple react-app to enable the editing, sharing, and comparison of non-escalator relationships. The app is designed to be used by a single user at a time, and does not require a backend server. The app is designed to be used in a browser, and is not optimized for mobile devices.
